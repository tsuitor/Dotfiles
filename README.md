After two years, this is my first attempt to standardize my dotfiles and 
push to github. Currently using fish as my default shell, with bash, zsh
as backups for the time being. Using Dotbot to manage the configuration.
Trying to learn PyCharm while learning Sublime Text 3, but with vim as my
goto default editor.

I still need to add oh-my-fish and/or tackle at least.  Will add enough
tooling to support Python development as well. Will probably add some of
the more popular dotfile configurations as well as something OS X related
(tbd).
